						<b> Course Reflection! </b> 
					</h1>
					<p>
						Now that my English 202 course is coming to a close, with my college career following in a few short months, I want to look back on what I’ve learned this semester, and the choices I made while creating this online portfolio for myself. Going into this semester I wasn’t really sure what English 202 was going to entail. I knew it was a technical writing course but I figured it would be just another English course. However as the semester draws to a close I think I’ve actually learned more from this course that will help me in my career than I have in most of my other courses. Sure my other ones taught me the foundations for writing that I used for this class, but most taught me how to write for professors or other academics, not for my coworkers or for a resume. This course has taught me a lot about how to write for people outside of my area of expertise, and I think it will be very helpful in my future since programming isn’t really a field a lot of people understand all the technical terms for. Before taking this course I had no idea how to write a resume, so I was woefully unprepared to actually apply for a job. The other topics we covered that I think will help me the most was writing an instruction set and process description for someone outside of your field. Programming involves a lot of technical terms that people who haven’t studied it won’t understand, so being able to properly explain my work will be an invaluable skill in my future careers. I think overall this course has been a great learning experience for me since it has taught me more about writing for potential and current employers than any of my other English classes I’ve taken during my entire educational career.

						<b>Portfolio</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Since I was designing the website for my portfolio from scratch the choices I made for the website layout were all about making something that was visually appealing but simple enough that it wouldn’t end up taking all of my time and preventing me from properly working on the content for the portfolio. The colors I chose for the website were ones I believe are easy to look at for long periods of time, and that don’t distract the user. For the overall design I went for a rather simple direction, partly for my own programming needs, but also so that it was easy to navigate. All of the navigation is done through a simple menu at the top of the page, and the sections you can go to are labeled so users can easily find what they need. I believe my past courses on Human Computer Interactions influenced my design choices. As for the actual content of the site I wanted to give users a good idea of who I am and what my skills are. The most important part for showing my skills was the projects section. I wanted to include projects that showed my skills as a programmer, so I chose some of the harder projects that I’ve worked on because I believe they give a better view of what I am capable of as a programmer. I also didn’t want to seem like I can only work with one language so I chose projects I worked on in a couple different languages to show that I am flexible with what I can do. Lastly though I wanted to show projects that were interesting. Anyone can make a console application so I instead chose things that were fun to work on, like the website itself or the games I have created for classes.
