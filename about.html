						<b> About Jason </b> 
					</h1>
					<p>
						Even at a young age I knew that I wanted to work with computers for my profession, but I was unsure what exactly I wanted to do with them until high-school. One of my days off I visited my father at his work, and he showed me some of the programs he was working on, and taught me how to write some very simple programs in C#. That was when I decided that I wanted to get into programming. Something about it was just so intriguing to me that I knew I wanted to learn more of it, and that it was what I wanted to major in. A couple years later and I got accepted to Penn State as a student in Comp Sci, and would eventually switch to Design and Development because I found the classes to be more interesting. During my time at Penn State I have studied many different programming languages including Java, Javascript, HTML, PHP, SQL, and C++. However most of my experience is with Java, and it is the language that I enjoy working with the most. 						
					</p>
					<h3>
						<b>Programming Experience</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						I am currently a senior at Penn State and am majoring in Design and Development. During my time at Penn State I have taken multiple courses on Java programming, but I have also taken courses that have taught me some basics in Javascript, HTML, PHP, SQL and C++, with the courses in HTML being the most extensive after Java. Even though I only took one course in C++, since my major focuses more on Java, I have on occasion practiced with it on my own, and chosen to use it for projects where I wasn't required to use a specific programming language.  I enjoy working with C++ since it is similar enough to Java that I am able to transfer most of my knowledge of Java to working with it, but it is also different enough that I find certain projects work easier with it. 
					</p>
					<h3>
						<b>Other Education</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Besides programming my time at Penn State has taught me many valuable skills. Through my IST courses I have learned basic networking, how to set up and maintain a computer database, and computer repair and maintenance. I have also taken courses on Security and Risk Analysis, Public Speaking, Web Development, and several different writing courses. Even though these courses aren't directly related to computer programming I believe that they have made me a well rounded individual and made me better at working on things that aren't directly part of my area of expertise. 
					</p>
					<h3>
						<b>Past Work Experience</b>
					</h3>
					<p>
						For the past four years I have been working in the IT Department at Penn State University. My work includes setting up new machines, maintaining our current computers, and providing technical support for the faculty and staff that works in the Hosler Building at Penn State. I have also learned how to maintain and set up servers for a small business.
